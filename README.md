# Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

## About
---
The purpose is by implementing Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch to understand the inner workings of the methods.

The following books and courses are used as references:
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
- [Linear Algebra and Learning from Data by Gilbert Strang](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Learning-Data-Scientific/dp/1107002176)
- [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaran Courville](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618)

This project is under development.
